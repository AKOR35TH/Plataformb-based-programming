let x = 10;
let y = 20;

let temp = x;
x = y;
y = temp;

// After swapping: x = 20, y = 10
//what happens here is that we use a temporary variable 'temp' 
// to hold the value of 'x' while we assign the value of 'y' to 'x'. 
// Then, we assign the value stored in 'temp' (which is the original value of 'x') 
// to 'y'. This effectively swaps the values of 'x' and 'y'.

//2. Simple Math with Variables
let a = 8;
let b = 3;

let sum = a + b;
let product = a * b;
let average = (a + b) / 2;


//3. Temperature Conversion
let celsius = 25;

let reaumur = (4 / 5) * celsius;
let fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32;
let kelvin = celsius + 273.15;

//4. Predict the Value
let a = 5;
let b = 2;
let result = a + b * a;

// result = 5 + (2 * 5) = 5 + 10 = 15
// The value of 'result' will be 15 because of operator precedence.
//Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so b * a is calculated first.
// Therefore, the expression is evaluated as a + (b * a).

//5. Combine Strings
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"
// Here, we concatenate the strings 'firstName' and 'lastName' with a space in between using the + operator.
// The result is stored in the variable 'fullName'.
//If you donâ€™t put a space between them, it becomes "JohnDoe", which is not the desired format.
